Description: This project aims at creating an editable PDF file
in order for the TVA Analysts to insert text and eventually
images.

Use: To begin, run the program finalPDF.py by:
'python finalPDF.py'
The program will execute with the base pdf 'base.pdf' and add
layers with each editable section that is included as a new
pdf, resulting now in 'blank7.pdf' as the final file.
